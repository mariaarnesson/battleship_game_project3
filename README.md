# Introduction
[View the live project here](https://battleship-game.herokuapp.com/)
This Battleships game is Portfolio Project 3 - Python Essentials created for Diploma in Full Stack Software Development at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/se/) . This project is about building a command-line application that allows users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain.

Battleship game is a Python Terminal Game, which runs in Heroku. 

The Battleships game is played on grids on which each player's fleet of battleships are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players call shots at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.
The application provides a working battleships game for a single user to play against the computer. 
# How to play 

After pressing on run the game, entering the user's name, the user can see the game instructions and a table showing the size of the ships. The user then places ships on his board by selecting letters in a column and numbers in a row. After placing their ships, the user guesses where the ships are on the computer board. The game ends when the computer or the user guesses where all the ships are.
